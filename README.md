Example with Knool Witch using yolauncher servermodpack and lifx framework

## Prerequisite

## Build Server Modpack for YoLauncher
To build a zip file that includes all the client side required files for yolauncher, simply run the included [bat file](createModpack.bat) (requires 7-zip as is)
Upload the genereated zip file to yolauncher and activate it as a modpack.

## Install on server.

Upload both the mods folder and the yolauncher to your server root directory, the mods reference the datablock from yolauncher folder to ensure it is the same as the one you made in the server modpack.
